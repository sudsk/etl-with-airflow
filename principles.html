<h2>DB1 Keys should be unique, meaningless and unchanging<a class="headerlink" href="#db1-keys-should-be-unique-meaningless-and-unchanging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>These are considered to be good principles for keys as it helps you avoid issues around using common data items like email addresses as the basis of some sort of key or identifier. Product codes are another common trap that are sometimes used as codes - which is fine until the product code changes</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="db2-access-to-databases-should-be-via-stored-procedures-but-logic-should-only-be-added-to-preserve-integrity-or-another-nfr-property">
<h2>DB2 Access to databases should be via stored procedures, but logic should only be added to preserve integrity or another NFR property<a class="headerlink" href="#db2-access-to-databases-should-be-via-stored-procedures-but-logic-should-only-be-added-to-preserve-integrity-or-another-nfr-property" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Direct table access should be avoided. Data extraction methods e.g. views, functions, stored procedures do provide an additional layer of security as the set of permitted operations on the database are constrained by removing direct table access permissions. This also provides an abstraction layer that can enable database structure changes to be abstracted out and thus isolate the change impact. Logic inside stored procedures is encouraged if it helps protect data integrity, security or performance and be a data logic. Information logic should be left for the application to handle.</p>

<div class="section" id="db3-we-should-make-use-of-database-change-control-tools-to-ease-the-maintenance-and-deployment-of-database-changes">
<h2>DB3 We should make use of database change control tools to ease the maintenance and deployment of database changes<a class="headerlink" href="#db3-we-should-make-use-of-database-change-control-tools-to-ease-the-maintenance-and-deployment-of-database-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The code to create/modify database structures and/or content must be controlled with the same rigour and comparable tools as that for those used for software applications. This also facilitates consistent test results across environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="db4-batch-jobs-should-demonstrate-linear-progress-with-time-by-committing-in-modest-batch-sizes">
<h2>DB4 Batch jobs should demonstrate linear progress with time by committing in modest batch sizes.<a class="headerlink" href="#db4-batch-jobs-should-demonstrate-linear-progress-with-time-by-committing-in-modest-batch-sizes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Batch jobs that are long running and either totally commit or totally roll-back are forbidden unless that behaviour is specifically required.</p>
<p>Bulk inserts into a database within a transactional scope tend to be more performant for a limited batch sizes within the range of 500-1000 rows. Extending the number of inserts beyond this size has two detrimental effects. Firstly the transaction rollback log file will grow very large and second progress becomes opaque. If you kill a job after 60 hours you lose all progress but yet the job might have fully completed after 5 more minutes.</p>
<p>AN ETL ‘job’ (control-m?) should be transparent and broken down into Steps &amp; Tasks (workflow).
Job → Steps → Tasks
The workflow should be defined, so that the Steps and Tasks are transparent and visible, and during execution it should be monitor-able to see progress made on Steps and Tasks.
Steps could be parallel or serial. [MDJ to reword]</p>

<div class="section" id="db5-batch-jobs-must-be-designed-to-be-automatically-restartable-from-the-point-where-they-left-off-and-be-idempotent">
<h2>DB5 Batch jobs must be designed to be automatically restartable from the point where they left off and be idempotent<a class="headerlink" href="#db5-batch-jobs-must-be-designed-to-be-automatically-restartable-from-the-point-where-they-left-off-and-be-idempotent" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Running the same batch job multiple times should only increase progress of the job until completion, it should not introduce any side-effects in terms of duplicated record creation. Running the same job on a data set already processed should have no side-effect</p>
<p>When you run ETL to load data from a source system into the DW, it is possible that you may need to restart the ETL load after a failure. After such a failure during ETL, to avoid restarting the entire ETL after a failure, which would require inefficient re-runs of all ETL tasks, you must restart the ETL from the same point in its execution once the cause of failure has been diagnosed and resolved.
Restartability Grain - When you restart an ETL after a failure, you may not restart again from the exact point of failure, depending on where it occurred and on dependencies between ETL steps. The point of restartability is that the end result of the ETL execution is the same regardless of any ETL failure.
To maintain data integrity in the case of restart, the grain would vary depending on the location in the hierarchy of the failed step and on the Restart setting for the step in the workflow definition. Basically meaning the restartability grain should be definable at a step level. [MDJ to reword]</p>

<p>It is vital that operations teams can monitor the observable progress of all long running batch jobs and the final outcome of the job.
The workflow should support monitoring Steps/Tasks completed, running and pending. All jobs must adhere to incremental progress in reasonable measures.</p>

<p>The database job is about data. The business context that turns it into ‘information’ is the application concern. Focus on each strength. The activities of the database should be focussed on the handling and manipulation of data and stay away from external services.</p>
