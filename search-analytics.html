<p>Initial selection was based on product literature, white-papers, product specifications, and external agency ranking (Forrester and DB-Engines). This table shows high level requirement-features and if the product meets it.</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>How to enforce data role filter to searches on the ‘fast search’ product? There are various ways to do this and it ties up with the choice of tool:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>Relational Joins - If the data role filter and the transaction data stores are on the same database, then a join would be most appropriate in this case.
- Oracle 12c In-Memory
- MemSQL</li>
<li>Distributed Joins - Join on the grid such as Apache Ignite. Colocated joins more performant than non-colocated.
- Apache Ignite (GridGain)</li>
<li>Client side push-down filter - The client constructs a list of data role filter (e.g. list of MIDs) using a query against a master data store, and then applies the list as filter to the second query against transactional data store. Both data stores can be same or entirely different technologies etc. The PoC should prove that we can run complex searches that also have a list of, say, 5000 MIDs added to the search criteria.
- All tools</li>
<li>Terms Lookup mechanism - Instead of specifying a filter with a lot of values it can be beneficial to fetch those values from a document in another index.
- Elasticsearch</li>

<p>## Sorting
- Sorting (order by) is the biggest blocker for sub-second performance for pagination queries
- User should apply filter to reduce the number of rows to 100K ideally or 1M max. (There is no way user is going to paginate through all the pages. Download is not real-time, need not be sorted, etc.)
- User can be shown the count and asked to apply more filter or reduce date range to bring it under the MAX allowed value.
- Or the application take the interim count and reduce the date range - assuming sorting is always and only on date transaction/processing column.</p>
<p>## Coherence IMDG
- Already using Coherence for WPOS session tokens
- Next plan is to extend usage with Master data caching such as merchant and user details for WPOS
- We put Coherence to test by adding further use cases with increasing complexity
- Build our experience on IMDGs in terms of replication &amp; partitioned caches, on-heap &amp; off-heap memory, correct GC, managing several nodes, managing XDCR, nodes rebalancing, collocated and non-collocated queries, synchronisation, goldengate integration, etc.
- Going with other IMDGs - GG/Ignite, Hazlecast, JBoss Infinispan, Gigaspaces XAP - and storing and managing billions of rows at this moment is too risky, but we shouldn’t rule out for future based on our Coherence extension experience.</p>
<p>## Oracle 12c In-Memory
- We don’t have In-Memory license
- In-memory performance was very good except when the range of input rows is huge (&gt;100M) to sort (order by)
- In-memory columnstore is not first class citizen unlike other memory products where the data moves through memory to persistence layer. Oracle In-memory columnstore is seeded from disk.</p>
<p>## MemSQL
- Good performance for billion of rows (MemSQL did a PoC with 26B rows)
- Very fast ingestion speed (&gt; 100k/s)
- Commercial license is memory based - $20k for 128GB RAM
- Data is stored ordered by index key. Reversing the order of index keys sort order results in very poor performance as it cannot use fast OrderedColumnstoreScan anymore.
- Queries which are not able to fan out to all nodes affects performance. (This should be seen with more testing to compare concurrent users using only one shard compared to concurrent fan-out queries using all shards - this could balance out itself.)
- Columnstore is built for sequential access, therefore random access on event-id has to be measured.
- It’s very likely that Corporate and SMEs will have different table design strategies. Performance issues can be seen for border merchants - like small corporates using SME table and vice-versa.
- Some query plan issues has been seen during PoC. Working with MemSQL on that.
- Some disk space increased usage during ingestion seen during PoC. Working with MemSQL on that.</p>
<p>## Elasticsearch
- Good tool of choice in non-relational space focussed on searches.
- Certain aggregations are approximate - such as count distinct and percentiles aggregation. (therefore all aggregations output should be verified for reliability.)
- Aggregation performance should be evaluated.
- SQL query support coming soon - though applications doesn’t need it. Current query DSL is more than enough.
- Terms filter with join to another index to be evaluated for data role filter.
- Elastic support license cost?</p>
